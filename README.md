# Airline-Reservation-JEE
<h4>This is the Phoenix airline pvt  web application, and this is the UI related to it. There’s only one login in the system for the staff, admin and user. There are two registration forms for staff and user. We give access to admin through the database.
1st landing page will be the home page and after going to the home page we have to book the tickets after creating the account. There’s a dashboard for the admin and admin can access the database through the login. Admin can add staff members or approve the staff accounts and monitor login details of the users and staff members. We create the admin dashboard’s control part using the JSP pages and servlet pages.
There are two staff categories as Grade 1 and Grade 2. Grade 1 staff members can access their dashboard and they can update flight details, ticket info and other details. 
Grade 2 staff members can access their dashboard and they can add flight details and access the user dashboard.
And both Grade 1 and Grade 2 staff members can access user dashboard.
