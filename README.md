Welcome to the Airline Reservation System! This project is developed using Java - Jakarta, providing an efficient and user-friendly solution for managing airline reservations. 

The user interface is designed using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript, ensuring a visually appealing and interactive experience for all users. 

This system consists of four panels to accommodate different roles:
- :crown: **Admin**: Administrators have full control over the system, managing flights, user accounts, and other administrative tasks.
- :office: **Staff grade 1**: This panel is dedicated to staff members with lower-level privileges, allowing them to handle customer inquiries, ticket reservations, and basic flight management.
- :briefcase: **Staff grade 2**: Staff members with higher-level privileges can access this panel, which grants them additional functionalities such as managing flight schedules, seating arrangements, and passenger details.
- :busts_in_silhouette: **User**: The user panel is designed for customers who can search for flights, book tickets, view their reservations, and update personal information.

The database is designed using SQL, ensuring secure and efficient storage and retrieval of data.
